	We study symmetric partial edge drawings (SPEDs) for non-planar graphs, in which edges are drawn only partially as pairs of opposing stubs of equal length on the respective end-vertices. It is known that maximizing the ink (or the total stub length) when transforming a straight-line drawing with crossings into a SPED is tractable for 2-plane input drawings, but generally NP-hard. We show that the problem remains NP-hard even for 3-plane input drawings. We also present efficient algorithms for ink maximization of $k$-plane input drawings whose edge intersection graph forms a collection of trees or cacti. %\verb|\FigureBorderfalse|.
